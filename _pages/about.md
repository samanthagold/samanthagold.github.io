I am a third year applied economics PhD student at Cornell Brooks Public Policy interested in early childhood cognitive development, health economics, and behavioral economics. Prior to Cornell, I was a pre-doctoral fellow at Brown University/Data Scientist at a tech for social good non-profit (RIPL). I graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Environmental Economics and Policy in 2016. Reachable at: sg972@cornell.edu
