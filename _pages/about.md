I am a second-year applied economics PhD student at Cornell Brooks Public Policy interested in health economics, environmental economics, and urban policy. Prior to Cornell, I was a pre-doctoral fellow at Brown University/economic analyst at a tech for social good non-profit (RIPL). I graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Environmental Economics and Policy in 2016. Reachable at: sg972@cornell.edu
